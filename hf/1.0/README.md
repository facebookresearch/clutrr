# Dataset Card for CLUTRR 

## Table of Contents

## Dataset Description
### Dataset Summary
**CLUTRR** (**C**ompositional **L**anguage **U**nderstanding and **T**ext-based **R**elational **R**easoning), a diagnostic benchmark suite, is first introduced in (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06177) to test the systematic generalization and inductive reasoning capabilities of NLU systems.  

The CLUTRR benchmark allows us to test a modelâ€™s ability for **systematic generalization** by testing on stories that contain unseen combinations of logical rules, and test for the various forms of **model robustness** by adding different kinds of superfluous noise facts to the stories.

### Dataset Task
CLUTRR contains a large set of semi-synthetic stories involving hypothetical families. The task is to infer the relationship between two family members, whose relationship is not explicitly mentioned in the given story.

## Dataset Structure
We show detailed information for all 14 configurations of the dataset.

### configurations:
**id**: a unique series of characters and numbers that identify each instance <br>
**story**: one semi-synthetic story involving hypothetical families<br>
**query**: the target query/relation which contains two names, where the goal is to classify the relation that holds between these two entities<br>
**target**: indicator for the correct relation for the query <br>
**target_text**: text for the correct relation for the query <br>
the indicator follows the rule as follows: <br> "aunt": 0, "son-in-law": 1, "grandfather": 2, "brother": 3,
    "sister": 4,
    "father": 5,
    "mother": 6,
    "grandmother": 7,
    "uncle": 8,
    "daughter-in-law": 9,
    "grandson": 10,
    "granddaughter": 11,
    "father-in-law": 12,
    "mother-in-law": 13,
    "nephew": 14,
    "son": 15,
    "daughter": 16,
    "niece": 17,
    "husband": 18,
    "wife": 19,
    "sister-in-law": 20  <br>
**clean\_story**: the story without noise factors<br>
**proof\_state**: the logical rule of the kinship generation <br>
**f\_comb**: the kinships of the query followed by the logical rule<br>
**task\_name**: the task of the sub-dataset in a form of "task_[num1].[num2]"<br> 
The first number [num1] indicates the status of noise facts added in the story: 1- no noise facts; 2- Irrelevant facts*; 3- Supporting facts*; 4- Disconnected facts*.<br>
The second number [num2] directly indicates the length of clauses for the task target.<br>
*for example:*<br>
*task_1.2 -- task requiring clauses of length 2 without adding noise facts*<br> 
*task_2.3 -- task requiring clauses of length 3 with Irrelevant noise facts added in the story*<br> 
**story\_edges**: all the edges in the kinship graph<br>
**edge\_types**: similar to the f\_comb, another form of the query's kinships followed by the logical rule <br>
**query\_edge**: the corresponding edge of the target query in the kinship graph<br>
**genders**: genders of names appeared in the story<br>
**task\_split**: train,test <br>

*Further explanation of Irrelevant facts, Supporting facts and Disconnected facts can be found in the 3.5 Robust Reasoning section in https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06177

### Data Instances

An example of 'train'in Task 1.2 looks as follows.
```
{

  "story": "[Lillian] and her daughter [April] went to visit [Lillian]'s mother [Ashley] last Sunday.",
  "query": ('April', 'Ashley'),
  "target": "grandmother",
  "clean_story": [Lillian] and her daughter [April] went to visit [Lillian]'s mother [Ashley] last Sunday.,
  "proof_state": [{('April', 'grandmother', 'Ashley'): [('April', 'mother', 'Lillian'), ('Lillian', 'mother', 'Ashley')]}],
  "f_comb": "mother-mother",
  "task_name": "task_1.2",
  "story_edges": [(0, 1), (1, 2)],
  "edge_types": ['mother', 'mother'],
  "query_edge": (0, 2),
  "genders": "April:female,Lillian:female,Ashley:female",
